# Welcome to CodeCaptain ðŸš€

CodeCaptain is a code analysis tool that helps you understand your codebase better.

## Getting started

1. Login with a forge like GitHub or GitLab
2. Add your repositories and index it
3. Once indexed, you can ask questions about your codebase. For example:
   - What is this project about?
   - Which programming languages are used in this project?
   - Could you explain the technical project structure to me?

## How does it work?

CodeCaptain clones your repository and indexes the source code and issues using llm embeddings into a vector database.
This allows it to search for similar code snippets and provide you with insights into your codebase when you ask
it a question.

## Changelog

- Added chats
